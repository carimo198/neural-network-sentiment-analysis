# Writing Neural Networks: Language processing with PyTorch
## Bi-LSTM model for analysing business reviews text 
### [Report: Writing neural networks with PyTorch link](https://carimo198.github.io/writing-neural-networks-with-pytorch/intro.html)
This repository is for my uni project for Nueral Networks, Deep Learning course. For this project we were required to write a Pytorch program that learns to read business reviews in text format and predict a rating (positive or negative) associated with each review, as well as a business category (0=Restaurants, 1=Shopping, 2=Home Services, 3=Health &amp; Medical, 4=Automotive). Please refer to a3.pdf for my report in which I have outline how the program works with explanation behind my design decisions.

The file student.py is completed to run in conjunction with a3main.py by typing the following command line in the terminal:

*python3 a3main.py*
